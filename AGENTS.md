# AI Coding Agent Instructions

## New Character Hand Positioning

When creating a new character, position the hands as two distinct circular side elements beside the central body, matching the approved reference: clean spacing, clear separation from the body, and no hand overlap unless explicitly requested.

## Post-Change Suggestions

This applies to any chat-based AI coding assistant working in this repository, regardless of IDE, extension, model, or provider, whenever these project instructions are loaded.

After making a code change, always conclude the final response with a `### 💡 Suggestions` section containing 2–4 concise, actionable follow-ups relevant to the change. Each suggestion must include:

- **Why**: The problem or opportunity it addresses.
- **Pros**: The concrete benefits.
- **Cons**: The trade-offs or maintenance cost.
- **Don't**: A specific pitfall to avoid.
- **Example Scenario**: A concrete situation where the follow-up would help.

Do not suggest work that was already completed. Keep each part to 1–2 sentences, and make the scenario realistic and directly connected to the suggestion. Follow the detailed standard in `.agents/rules/post-change-suggestions.md`.

This is an always-on project instruction, not an on-demand skill. IDEs and chat agents differ in how they discover project instructions; configure any tool that does not automatically load the root `AGENTS.md` to include it as project context.

VS Code's Local agent harness also runs the Stop reminder in `.github/hooks/post-change-suggestions.json`, gated by Git changes during the current prompt. Other IDEs or hosted agent harnesses need their own supported Stop-hook configuration.
